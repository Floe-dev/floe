One of the most surprising things I've witnessed in my lifetime is the rebirth
of the concept of heresy.

In his excellent biography of Newton, Richard Westfall writes about the moment
when he was elected a fellow of Trinity College: Supported comfortably, Newton
was free to devote himself wholly to whatever he chose. To remain on, he had
only to avoid the three unforgivable sins: crime, heresy, and marriage. [1] The
first time I read that, in the 1990s, it sounded amusingly medieval. How
strange, to have to avoid committing heresy. But when I reread it 20 years later
it sounded like a description of contemporary employment.
