## Getting started

Check out the [tutorial](https://www.notion.so/floe-dev/Docs-UI-Templates-ef503e987aaa4dabb1e388cac9e14d62?pvs=4) in the (temporary) docs to get started.

## Motivation

**Product release comms are hard.** Beamer, Canny, Product Board and a dozen other companies offer some great solutions for rolling content for a release, annoucements, and getting feedback. But when it comes to control and customization, they fall flat. Not only that, but these tools don't enforce a single source of truth; instead your changelogs, blogs, and docs get spread across multiple services.

That's where Floe comes in:

**Open source**
Great products are built through collaboration and feedback. That's why Floe is completely open source.

**Single source of truth**
Floe is backed by git. Use your codebase as your single source of truth.

**Content <> UI de-coupling**
Treat your content for what it really is: data. Co-locate your data with code across multiple repositories. Plus, there's no need to redeploy your templates everytime you ship a data change.

**Built on React**
Get started quickly with a pre-built Floe template. Or use Floe's Primitives library to create your own.

## Project status

Floe is in alpha. While in alpha, you can expect bugs, and breaking changes to the API may occur. That being said, the project is starting to reach a point of stability. If you need more stability, I would recommend waiting for the beta. Check the [changelog](https://www.floe.dev/changelog) for status updates.

I am actively looking for feedback and open to contributors (please reach out in [contributing](https://discord.gg/EHwDvBhKHk) channel).
