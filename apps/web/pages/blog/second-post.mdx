You can know a great deal about something without writing about it. Can you ever
know so much that you wouldn't learn more from trying to explain what you know?
I don't think so. I've written about at least two subjects I know well — Lisp
hacking and startups — and in both cases I learned a lot from writing about
them. In both cases there were things I didn't consciously realize till I had to
explain them. And I don't think my experience was anomalous. A geat deal of
knowledge is unconscious, and experts have if anything a higher proportion of
unconscious knowledge than beginners.
