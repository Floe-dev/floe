# Quick start
Welcome to the **Floe** documentation guide. This guide will help you get
started with the Floe in under 5 minutes.

## Before you start
These docs assume you have completed onboarding through the [Floe
dashboard](https://app.floe.dev). You should also have generated an API key and have it ready.

## Getting started

### 1. Install the CLI
The easiest way to get started with Floe is with the **Floe CLI**. The CLI works
with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/),
[yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/), [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/), and
[bun](https://bun.sh/).

The following command will install the CLI globally.

<Tabs items={['npm', 'yarn', 'pnpm', 'bun']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```bash copy
    npm i -g @floe/cli
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```bash copy
    yarn global add @floe/cli
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```bash copy
    pnpm add -g @floe/cli
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```bash copy
    bun add -g @floe/cli
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout emoji="ðŸ’¡"> Should you wish to pin the CLI version, you may remove the
  `-g` flag and install the CLI locally to your project.</Callout>

  ### 2. Initialize Floe
  Use the setup wizard to install the `.floe` directory. You should run this in the root of your documentation repository.

  ```bash copy
  floe init
  ```
  <Callout emoji="ðŸ’¡"> If you are installing into a monorepo, run in the same directory as your `.git` file.</Callout>
