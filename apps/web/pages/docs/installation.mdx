# Installation

## Account setup

<Steps>
### Fork and clone the repository
```bash copy
git@github.com:<OWNER>/floe.git
cd floe
```

### Install dependencies
```bash copy
pnpm i
```

### Register a GitHub app
- Follow the [Registering a GitHub App docs](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/registering-a-github-app/registering-a-github-app)
- Enable the following settings:
  - Set the callback URL to `http://localhost:3001/api/installation-callback`
  - Check ON `Request user authorization (OAuth) during installation` and `Enable Device Flow`
  - Enable the following permisions:
    - Contents: Read-only
    - Issues: Read & write
    - Metadata: Read-only
    - Pull requests: Read & write
    - Members: Read-only
- Keep this page open. You will need to get your `App ID`, `Client ID`, `Client secret` and `Private key` handy for later

### Create your database
- Setup a MySQL database. You can do this locally or through a cloud provider. Floe uses PlanetScale.

### Setup Vercel
- In Vercel, create a Project. You can create it from the GitHub repository you just forked.
- Setup a Redis KV store. You can do this through the Vercel dashboard on the 'Storage' page.
- Keep your environment variables handy for later.

</Steps>

## Setup environment variables

Next, we need to setup our environment variables.

<Steps>
### Copy .env.example files
Create a `.env` by copying the `.env.example` file in the following directories:
<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="Root" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.File name=".env.example" />
    <FileTree.Folder name="apps" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.Folder name="app" defaultOpen>
        <FileTree.File name=".env.example" />
      </FileTree.Folder>
      <FileTree.Folder name="api" defaultOpen>
        <FileTree.File name=".env.example" />
      </FileTree.Folder>
    </FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.Folder name="act" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.File name=".env.example" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

### `DATABASE_URL`
- Set the `DATABASE_URL` to your MySQL database. If you are using PlanetScale,
  you can get this by running `pscale connect <DATABASE_NAME> --port 3309` and
  copying the `DATABASE_URL` from the output.
- Set the `DATABASE_URL` to `mysql://root@127.0.0.1:3309/<DATABASE_NAME>?connection_limit=100`

### `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`
- Generate a cryptographically secure string and set it as the
  `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`. The easiest way to do this is to run `openssl rand -base64
  32` in your terminal.

### `FLOE_SECRET_IV` and `FLOE_SECRET_KEY`
- Generate a 16 and 32 character cryptographically string and set them as the `FLOE_SECRET_IV` and
  `FLOE_SECRET_KEY` respectively. The easiest way to do this is to run `openssl
  rand -base64 16` and `openssl rand -base64 32` in your terminal.

### Remaining variables
- You should be able to fill most other variables if you followed the Prerequisites and Installation steps.
- You will not yet have created keys for `FLOE_API_WORKSPACE` or `FLOE_API_SECRET` yet.

</Steps>

## Running the app
<Steps>
### Sync your database
Run this from the `packages/db` directory.
```bash copy
npx prisma db push
```

### Seed your database
Run this from the `packages/db` directory.
```bash copy
npx prisma db seed
```
Copy the output at the end. This will be needed to login.

### Start the app
Let's start the app (finally ðŸŽ‰)!

```bash copy
pnpm dev
```

This should have started 3 dev servers:
- Website: http://localhost:3000
- Dashboard: http://localhost:3001
- API: http://localhost:4000

### Login
Go to http://localhost:3001 and enter the auth cookie you copied earlier into
your console. Or, if you entered a `SENDGRID_API` key you can enter an email to
signup manually. You should receive an email with a link to verify your account.
That's it!
