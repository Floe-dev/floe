Earlier this month I released the close beta for Floe Reviews â€” a programmatic
way to test your documentation (or code) against a set of rules. It's kind of
like an AI-powered linter.

While I've been building AI applications for a while now (years if you include
my time at Ada.cx), this was the hardest to 'get right'.


## Break down the problem

- Make the AI's job as easy as possible
- Line numbering example
- Break larger tasks into smaller ones

## Keep it simple

I have a sticky note next to my desk that I look at every day. It just says:
"Keep it simple". As a solo founder, this has been one of the most important things
I've learned, and it applies just as much to AI engineering as it does to product
design, marketing, or anything else.

Make a quick Google search for 
- Don't need LangChain
- Don't need to prematurely fine-tune


## Test and iterate

AI engineering is unlike . Results are generally subjective and indeterministic.
Ultimately, achieving the desired outcome is a matter of trial and error.
