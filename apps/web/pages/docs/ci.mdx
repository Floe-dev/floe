# CI

Using the Floe Reviews GitHub Action is the easiest way to integrate Floe
Reviews into your CI pipeline. The action will automatically review your pull
request diffs and leave comments for issues and suggested fixes.

## Usage

Copy the following workflow into the repository's `.github/workflows` directory.

<Callout emoji="ðŸ’¡">Be sure to set `FLOE_API_WORKSPACE` and
`FLOE_API_SECRET` on the "Actions secrets and variables" page in your GitHub
settings. `GITHUB_TOKEN` is available by default.</Callout>

```yaml copy filename=".github/workflows/floe-review.yml"
name: "Floe Review"
on:
  pull_request:

jobs:
  Review:
    env:
      FLOE_API_WORKSPACE: ${{ secrets.FLOE_API_WORKSPACE }}
      FLOE_API_SECRET: ${{ secrets.FLOE_API_SECRET }}
      GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Checkout the Floe repository
      - name: Checkout Floe
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          repository: Floe-dev/floe
          ref: "@floe/review-action@0.1.0-beta.5"
          path: ./.github/actions/floe-actions

      # Run the review action
      - name: Review
        uses: ./.github/actions/floe-actions/actions/review-action
```

## Versioning

The Floe Review GitHub Action is versioned using the `ref` attribute and passing
a git tag. You can find the latest `@floe/review-action`
[here](https://github.com/Floe-dev/floe/tags).

You can keep Floe up to date with the latest versioning by removing the `ref`,
but this is not recommended while Floe is in beta.
