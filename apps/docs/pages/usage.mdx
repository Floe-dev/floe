# Basic usage
Let's use an example. Say we want to enforce specific terminology in our
documentation.

{/* <Callout emoji="ðŸ’¡">These commands assume you have configured `.floe/config.json`.</Callout> */}
<Steps>
### Add a rule
```markdown copy filename=".floe/rules/terminology.md"
Make sure to always use the following terminology instead of these alternatives:

- `main` instead of `master`
- "Floe" instead of "Floe.dev"
# ...
```

### Add the rule to a ruleset
```json copy filename=".floe/config.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://unpkg.com/@floe/config@0.1.0-alpha.5/schema.json",
  "reviews": {
    "maxFileEvaluations": 5,
    "maxDiffEvaluations": 20
  },
  "rulesets": {
    "docs": {
      "include": ["**/*.mdx"],
      "rules": {
        "terminology": "error"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
### Profit!
We can now start using the CLI to review our changes.

#### Review unstaged changes
```bash copy
# This is the same as running `floe review diff HEAD`
floe review diff
```

#### Review the last commit
```bash copy
floe review diff HEAD~1
```

#### Review an existing file
```bash copy
floe review files some/path/to/file.md
```
