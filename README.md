## Motivation

**Product release comms are hard.** Beamer, Canny, Product Board and a dozen other companies offer some great solutions for rolling content for a release, annoucements, and getting feedback. But when it comes to control and customization, they fall flat. Not only that, but these tools don't enforce a single source of truth; instead your changelogs, blogs, and docs get spread across multiple services.

That's where Floe comes in:

- **Open source**
  Great products are built through collaboration and feedback. That's why Floe is completely open source.

- **Content as data**
  Treat your content for what it really is: data. Stop worrying about managing UI templates. Just write Markdown, ship, repeat.

- **Co-locate Content + Code**
  Write your content where it's relevant. Use the same repository for your content as your source code.

- **Single source of truth**
  Floe is backed by git. Use your codebase as your single source of truth.

- **Built on React**
  Get started quickly with a pre-built Floe template. Or use Floe's Primitives library to create your own.

## Project status

Floe is in alpha. While in alpha, you can expect bugs, and breaking changes to the API may occur. That being said, the project is starting to reach a point of stability. If you need more stability, I would recommend waiting for the beta. Check the [changelog](https://www.floe.dev/changelog) for status updates.
