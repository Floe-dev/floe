# Configuration (`.floe` directory)

Checkout the docs below.

All the configuration for your project is stored in the `.floe` directory. This
directory is created when you run the `floe init` command. The `.floe` directory
contains the following files and directories:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name=".floe" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.File name="config.json" />
    <FileTree.Folder name="rules">
      <FileTree.File name="example-rule1.md" />
      <FileTree.File name="example-rule2.md" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.Folder name="templates">
      <FileTree.File name="example-template1.md" />
      <FileTree.File name="example-template2.md" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

- `config.json` - The main configuration file for your project.
- `rules` - Directory containing `.md` files that define the rules for your
  project.
- `templates` - Directory containing `.md` files that define the templates for
  your project (coming soon).


## Rules

A rule is a `.md` file that defines a rule for your project. The name of the
file is the name of the rule. For example, if you have a rule called
`spelling-and-grammar`, you would create a file called `spelling-and-grammar.md`
in the `rules` directory. The contents of the file are the description of the
rule. For example:

```md copy filename=".floe/rules/spelling-and-grammar.md"
Make sure there are no spelling mistakes or grammatical errors.
```

## Rulesets

A `ruleset` is a collection of rules. Rulesets are defined in the `config.json`.
Using the previous example, you might define a ruleset called `docs` like so:

```json copy filename=".floe/config.json"
{
  // rest of config...
  "rulesets": {
    "docs": {
      "include": ["**/*.md"],
      "rules": {
        "spelling-and-grammar": "warn"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
You can define as many rulesets and rules as you want, but it is important to
keep in mind that 'less is more'. Ideally you should have no more than ~3 rules
per ruleset. Having more than this may lead to rate limiting, particularly when
evaluating large text inputs.

### Filtering files
You can filter which files are evaluated by using the `include` field. You may
pass `include` an array of [glob patterns](https://www.npmjs.com/package/glob).

### Rule severity
You can define the severity of a rule by passing a string to the rule. The
following severity levels are available:

- `warn` - The rule will warn you if it finds a violation.
- `error` - The rule will error if it finds a violation. This will cause the
  `floe` command to exit with a non-zero exit code.
